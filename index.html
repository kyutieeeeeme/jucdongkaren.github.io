        <p style="font-size: 25px">What Is Bubble Tea?</p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 15px;">Bubble tea is a cold, flavored tea beverage that contains large chewy tapioca balls, making it an interactive drink and a sweet snack. Easy to recognize, bubble tea is paired with a colorful jumbo straw that’s both visually appealing and functional. With every sip of bubble tea, the tapioca pearls move easily up the wide straw. You’ll hear this Taiwanese drink referred to by several different names, including boba tea, pearl milk tea, boba milk tea, bubble milk tea, or simply boba.</p>

   <p style="font-size: 15px">Bubble milk tea starts with a base of tea or juice. Milk powders, flavoring syrups, and sweeteners are added to the base, and the whole drink is shaken until it's frothy and full of bubbles. For the finishing touch, boba pearls and other toppings are added. Part of the fun of bubble tea is the ability to customize the drink with different teas, flavors, and toppings.</p>

       <p style="font-size: 20px">Bubble tea menus usually offer three types of boba tea:</p>
       
  <ul>
     <li style="font-size: 15px"> Milk Tea - Teas, fruit flavors, or herbal flavors are combined with sweetened milk for a creamy beverage. Bossen taro is a popular milk powder with a nutty, vanilla flavor and a vibrant purple hue.</li>
   </ul>
   <ul>
     <li>Flavored Tea - These sweetened teas contain added flavorings but no milk (jasmine green tea, honey black tea).</li>
   </ul>
   <ul>
     <li>Juice - Bubble tea can be made without any tea at all! Fruit juice boba contains juice and no milk (passion fruit, mango, kiwi).</li>
       </ul>
